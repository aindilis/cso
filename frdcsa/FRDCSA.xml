    Comprehensive Software Ontology
  </short-description>
  <medium-description>
    The result of spidering and information extraction in the domain
    of software applications.  A subsystem of RADAR that integrates
    online software metadata sites.  Defines a metadata standard for
    the MyFRDCSA and provides search functions of metadata
    information.  Eventually these capabilities will join with others
    such as spidering and sophisticated focused web searching and
    classification techniques for actual web-mining of software and
    issuing automatic retrieval tactics.  It handles reputation
    management of online sources.

      CSO implements the comprehensive software ontology system.  It
      uses spider to gather software systems, and interfaces with
      RADAR and Architect.  It provides question answering services,
      particularly with respect to interapplication relations, and
      system capabilities.  It tracks many key features such as
      licensing and, along with MyFRDCSA, implements an archive of
      free software to enforce license violations.  Another feature it
      implements is extraction of capabilities from the systems.

      This is  a program  to maintain a  list of possible  and checked
      apt-get sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can  use apt-get.org,  sources found  on the  internet, previous
      sources, and runs frequency checks on these sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also  used  for  tracking  the  packages  available  from  these
      sources,  and, if  necessary,  for handling  the archiving  with
      myfrdcsa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Track which sources are bad.
